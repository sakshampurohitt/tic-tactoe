# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns to place their markers ("O" or "X") on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after each move and declares the result when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.

## Features:

- **Grid and Markers**: The game board consists of 9 boxes where players can click to place either "O" or "X".
- **Winning Condition**: The game checks for winning combinations after each move based on predefined patterns.
- **Reset**: Players can reset the game board to start a new game.

## How to Play:

1. Click on any empty box to place your marker ("O" starts first).
2. The game alternates turns between "O" and "X".
3. The game declares a winner if any player completes a row, column, or diagonal with their marker.
4. If all boxes are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Code Explanation:
